    	<p>Yahtzee is a dice game based on Poker. The object of the game is to roll certain combinations of numbers with five dice. At each turn you throw dice trying to get a good combination of numbers; different combinations give different scores. While luck plays a big role in Yahtzee, strategy makes a significant difference. The reason for this is that you score each combination just once, and the number of different combinations in which you can score is equal to the number of turns in the game. This means that you have to make wise choices about when to score in each combination and you have to be careful about what combinations you seek at each turn.</p>
